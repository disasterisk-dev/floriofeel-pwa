# Floriofeel PWA
Floriofeel is a Progressive Web App that aims to provide users with a simple method of journaling their emotional state using the interface of Victorian-era flower language.
Floriofeel was the first web app I developed and was part of my Master's. Beyond the practice of development, this app was an exercise in identifying a gap in the market and finding novel ways to engage with users.
Despite how rough and ready it is in places I'm very proud of Floriofeel, and while I could rebuild it with everything I've learned since it stands as a good comparison against my more recent work

### Purpose
Floriofeel was devised as a way for people to express and keep a log of their feelings without needing to put it into words. The idea is that the more frequently the user engages with the app, the more they associate a certain flower with their feelings. Using an abstract representation, the app removes the barrier of understanding your feelings, allowing the user to keep track using intuition and habit.
In theory, feelings could have been represented by any number of abstractions, colours, shapes, or animals for example; but I felt it was best that I stick with an established system of symbolism, as I'm not exactly a qualified psychologist. 
I chose floriography, a system of meaning and language through flowers, as it offered a very wide range of meanings to choose from and a gentle, calming vibe.

### Firebase
Google's Firebase platform is the driving force behind this app. Firebase is a Backend as a Service (BaaS), meaning it provides all the major functionality a web or native app needs out of the box.
In particular, I made use of the service's authentication features, along with its realtime database.
Google is surprisingly generous with its free tier, meaning that the app is still up and running at no cost almost 4 years after I deployed it.

### Front-end
The front end of the app is very low-tech, I developed Floriofeel before learning React so it relies on a very rudimentary system of individual HTML pages to deliver content to the user.
